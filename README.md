# Teardown Unofficial Modding Framework Examples

This repo contains mods I use to test the [UMF](https://github.com/Thomasims/TeardownUMF/tree/0.5.0), including some fun tools that you may want to use yourself.
As this is primarily a testbed for UMF functionality, _these mods will not work properly without [the latest version of UMF](https://github.com/Thomasims/TeardownUMF/archive/0.5.0.zip)_

# Installing

- Install the latest version of the UMF, available [here](https://github.com/Thomasims/TeardownUMF/tree/0.5.0).
- Place the mods you want to use in `Documents/Teardown/mods/`
